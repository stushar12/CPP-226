Min distance between two given nodes of a Binary Tree













https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/min-distance-between-two-given-nodes-of-a-binary-tree/1#












Dist(n1, n2) = Dist(root, n1) + Dist(root, n2) - 2*Dist(root, lca) 













'n1' and 'n2' are the two given keys









'root' is root of given Binary Tree.











'lca' is lowest common ancestor of n1 and n2



























Dist(n1, n2) is the distance between n1 and n2.
